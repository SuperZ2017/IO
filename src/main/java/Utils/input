 * Instantiate a new bean instance of the given class with the specified autowire
 * strategy. All constants defined in this interface are supported here.
 * Can also be invoked with {@code AUTOWIRE_NO} in order to just apply
 * before-instantiation callbacks (e.g. for annotation-driven injection).
 * <p>Does <i>not</i> apply standard {@link BeanPostProcessor BeanPostProcessors}
 * callbacks or perform any further initialization of the bean. This interface
 * offers distinct, fine-grained operations for those purposes, for example
 * {@link #initializeBean}. However, {@link InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor}
 * callbacks are applied, if applicable to the construction of the instance.
